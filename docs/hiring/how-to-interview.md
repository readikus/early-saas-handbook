# What to Ask

When conducting an interview, it's crucial to make the best use of both your time and the candidate's. One of the most ineffective and outdated approaches is starting with "Talk me through your CV." This question indicates a lack of preparation and can set a negative tone for the interview. If you're interviewing someone, it should be because you've reviewed their CV and believe they have the potential to fit the role. Instead of rehashing their resume, focus on specific, insightful questions that delve into their experience and skills. For example, "Can you tell us more about the Rust microservice project you worked on?" This approach not only demonstrates that you've done your homework but also encourages the candidate to discuss relevant experiences in detail.

# What Factors to Look For

## Attention to Detail

One of the key traits to assess in a candidate is their attention to detail. During the interview, share detailed information about your product, market, and short-term goals. Later, revisit these topics to gauge how well they have absorbed and understood the details. This can be a strong indicator of their attentiveness and ability to retain complex information.

## Curiosity and Continuous Learning

Evaluate whether the candidate stays updated with the latest tech trends and shows curiosity about how things work. Ask questions that reveal their passion for learning and their enthusiasm for new technologies. For instance, "What recent technological advancement are you most excited about?" or "How do you keep your skills up to date?"

## Communication Skills

Effective communication is essential in any role. Pay attention to how the candidate explains their past projects and experiences. A significant red flag is if they dominate the conversation without allowing you to interject. This can indicate poor communication skills and a lack of respect for others' time. An ideal candidate should be able to succinctly convey their thoughts and engage in a balanced dialogue.

## Positive Interview Experience

Creating a positive interview experience is paramount, even if the candidate isn't the right fit. A respectful and engaging interview process leaves a good impression, which can be beneficial in the long run. Candidates who have a positive experience are more likely to speak well of your company, potentially referring other talented individuals. The only time to consider terminating an interview prematurely is if the candidate displays behavior that is fundamentally misaligned with your company's values, such as using offensive language or expressing discriminatory views (I've had this once when asking about a candidate's experience with accessibility).

### Diversity and Inclusion

**Importance of Diversity**: Discuss the significance of diversity and inclusion within your startup. Emphasize how diverse teams bring varied perspectives and innovative ideas, leading to better decision-making and creativity.

**Inclusive Interview Practices**: Outline inclusive interview strategies such as avoiding biased questions, ensuring diverse interview panels, and creating an environment where candidates feel respected and valued.

**Commitment to Diversity**: Communicate your startup's commitment to fostering a diverse workforce and creating an inclusive culture where all employees can thrive.

### Motivation and Passion

**Understanding Motivation**: Explore methods to uncover what motivates candidates beyond technical skills, such as asking about their career goals, what excites them about your startup's mission, and how they envision contributing to your company's success.

**Passion for the Mission**: Encourage candidates to articulate their understanding of your startup's mission and how it aligns with their personal values and career aspirations. This can include discussing specific products or initiatives that resonate with them.

**Evaluating Commitment**: Assess candidates' level of enthusiasm and commitment to your startup by probing into their past experiences, achievements, and reasons for wanting to join your team.

### Career Path and Alignment with Startup

**Career Goals Discussion**: Engage candidates in a conversation about their long-term career aspirations and how they see themselves progressing within your startup. This helps gauge alignment between their career goals and the opportunities your startup can provide.

**Fit with Startup's Growth**: Discuss how candidates envision contributing to and growing with your startup as it scales. This could involve exploring their interest in taking on new challenges, learning opportunities, or leadership roles within your organization.

**Understanding of Product and Mission**: Evaluate candidates' understanding of your startup's product offerings, market position, and overarching mission. Ask specific questions to assess their knowledge and passion for the industry your startup operates in.

These sections not only enrich the interview process by focusing on important aspects beyond technical skills but also align candidates' motivations and career aspirations with your startup's goals and culture.

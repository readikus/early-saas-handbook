# Deciding what skills you need

NEVER EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER start an interview asking the candidate to "talk me through your CV". Why are you interviewing someone? Because you read their CV, and think they could be a good fit. Is that a good use of time?

If you have some questions - i.e. "please tell us about this project you built a Rust microservice...".

The "talk me through your CV" is the worst interview questions, and a red flag that the interviewer has done no research in how to do good interviews. Sure, if you want to go into detail on details, ask specifics, but don't get someone to read through a document that was the entire basis for why you decided to interview that person.

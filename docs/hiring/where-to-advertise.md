# Where to advertise

## Otta!!

Otta has a good experience from a hiring manager point of view, but is awful for candidates. I only knew about it from a hiring perspective, but when I was moving jobs, I saw how awful the experience was.

## Hacker News "Who's Hiring"

Gets a decent audience.

## Indeed

Seems to be pretty popular still, which surprised me.

## AngelList

Expect some fake applications, but still some interesting people still active on the site.

## Hired

Don't bother. Not even worth explaining this.

## Cord

Maybe one of the better places, but a lot of chancers on here.

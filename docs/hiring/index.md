# Conducting Respectful and Inclusive Recruitment

When engaging in the recruitment process, it's crucial to approach it with sensitivity and inclusivity. Recognize that the decisions you make have a personal impact on individuals, as you assess them based on various criteria. It can be challenging not to take this personally. Your ultimate goal is to hire individuals who can effectively drive progress with a good balance of speed and quality. However, it's important to ensure that the hiring process does not cause distress to the candidates you choose not to hire. Keep in mind that the startup community is relatively small, and word spreads quickly. Therefore, it's essential to treat candidates respectfully, just as you would want to be treated if you were in their position and facing rejection. It's crucial to be mindful that many people may be actively seeking employment due to recent layoffs, which can lead to heightened stress levels and sensitivities.

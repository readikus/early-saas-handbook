# Interview processes for early stage SaaS roles

The main objective from any technical hiring process is to find the best fit from the talent pool, ensure that they have the right skills and attitude for your startup, whilst also being respectful to the candidates time and not interogating them.

## Don't be a dick

This is the golden rule with interviewing. Don't be that interviewer with the unanswerable questions. Any experienced engineer will have a story to tell of some narcatist interviewer who wanted to inflate their ego by setting some technical question that only they could answer.





When engaging in the recruitment process, it's crucial to approach it with sensitivity and inclusivity. Recognize that the decisions you make have a personal impact on individuals, as you assess them based on various criteria. It can be challenging not to take this personally. Your ultimate goal is to hire individuals who can effectively drive progress with a good balance of speed and quality. However, it's important to ensure that the hiring process does not cause distress to the candidates you choose not to hire. Keep in mind that the startup community is relatively small, and word spreads quickly. Therefore, it's essential to treat candidates respectfully, just as you would want to be treated if you were in their position and facing rejection. It's crucial to be mindful that many people may be actively seeking employment due to recent layoffs, which can lead to heightened stress levels and sensitivities.



 Interviewing is a deeply personal and stressful thing, and you should always work towards making it as smooth and positive as possible. Whilst that particular candidate may not be a good fit for the role, their best friend may be, and word gets around. Last thing you want is a negative Glassdoor review. 

I've only ever canned an interview midway through, and that was when someone used offensive language to describe people who require accessible websites, and they found accessibility boring. I told them that it was a good point to wrap the interview, as this would not be a great fit for them.

# A model interview process

Decide on your process early on. Think of a colleague/friend who you would love to have on the team, and see if they are willing to role play your interview process with you. Assuming it is someone you have worked with before, and you know they'd be a great fit, you need to make sure your process gets the best from them.

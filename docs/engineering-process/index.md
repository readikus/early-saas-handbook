# We're getting the band back together!

Selecting the right engineers is a crucial decision. Talented engineers can significantly contribute to the product's success, while poor hires can hinder progress and negatively impact the product.

The main thing you need to do is:

* Decide what skills you need experience in.
* Decide what skills you can compromise on, and trust a good engineer to learn.
* Writing a good job description that makes people want to work with you.
* Work out where to advertise.
* Work with recruiters (optional)

The flip side of this is dealing with the common problems. With such a limited budget, the worst thing you can do is hang on to a hire who doesn't drive the product forward. Early stage companies are not a great fit for an early-career engineer, and favour engineers that are willing to commit a lot of time to the cause, or they're so good that well-engineered features just pour out of them, and you don't really care if they've spent most of the day looking for where to go on holiday or writing some sort of blog on how to run an engineering team in an early stage startup.

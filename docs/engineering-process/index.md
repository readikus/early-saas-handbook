# We're getting the band back together!

Picking the _right_ engineers is one of the most important steps you will take.

- Deciding what skills you need
- Writing a good job description that makes people want to work with you
- Where to advertise
- Working with recruiters

I find recruiters pretty annoying - the key is finding the non-condescending ones that believe their own LinkedIn posts.

Realistic fees are 10-20%. Anything quoted over 20% is disrespectful, so ignore that.

- Develop an assessment process.
- No twat policy
- Dealing with poor performance

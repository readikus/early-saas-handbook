# Code Reviews

A good code review consists of the following:

1. Checkout the branch locally, update dependancies etc.
2. Test the code works locally and you can perform the enhancement/bug fix that it is solving.
3. Does it look like it will affect other areas of the app? Check these still work.
4. Ensure it passes all the criteria, as per ([this is ready](../product/definition-of-done.md)).
5. When an issue is raised, only the person creating the issue should resolve that conversation.

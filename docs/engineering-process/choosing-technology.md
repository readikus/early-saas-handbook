React is pretty good. It's not perfect, but do you really want to be responsible for maintaining a whole front end project, or do you want to focus on solving user problems?

## Factors to look for

When deciding what technology to use, here are some metrics I look for:

- ask friends for their view.
- how long has the product been going?

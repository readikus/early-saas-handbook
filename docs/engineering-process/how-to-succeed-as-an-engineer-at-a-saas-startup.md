# How to succeed as an engineer at a SaaS startup

## Personal Traits

One of the most important factors for success of a seed stage startup is prioritisation. You are in a race against time to find product/market fit, so what we are working on needs to make the most use of our valuable time. This influences a lot of our technical decisions and how we approach work. Balancing this, with product quality, features and UX is something we should remind ourselves of every day.

As a developer, the important factors of success at an early stage start up are:

- Strikes a balance between innovation, technical excellence and delivery.
- Willing to ask when you are not sure how something works in the app.
- A willingness to do the boring stuff.
- Able to capture requirements comprehensively and ensure user stories fulfill all of them.
- A [learn-it-all](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/industry-blog/en-gb/cross-industry/2019/10/01/introduce-learn-it-all-culture/) outlook and be open to other people's ideas.
- Engaged in what we are delivering and care about delivering quality work for our audience.
- Not needing to be reminded of the same issues every PR.
- Reduces technical debt when possible as part of developing new features.
- Closely follows our [coding standards](./coding-standards).
- Throughly read and pre-review your code before requesting a review. Remove any commented out code, unnecessary new lines, and check comments are added for edge cases.
- Discusses large technical changes with the team before implmenting them.
- Test-driven mindset.
- Contributes to the culture and education of the tech team.


## Habits to Learn

### Deliver for the Product

Before diving into coding, invest time in thoroughly comprehending the product requirements associated with your current user story. This entails not just knowing *what* needs to be done, but understanding *why* it's needed. What pain point or problem does it address for our users? What specific actions or tasks will the users perform with this new functionality? A deep understanding of these aspects will guide your development efforts in the right direction.

Recognize that the work assigned to you is prioritized for a reason. It represents a critical piece of functionality that the application is yet to offer. In the grand scheme of things, this could be the feature that defines the early success of our startup. Therefore, treat it as a top priority, even if it is boring to build.

While it's natural to be eager to build exciting features or work on those shiny, dreamy aspects of the product, it's essential to resist the temptation to rush through the foundational work. The piece you're currently tasked with is the cornerstone upon which those exciting features will be built. Rushing through it risks compromising the quality and stability of the entire application.

### Take Notes

I consider this a super power. Early stage start ups seldom have an dedicated product manager who will capture the nuanced details of each user story, so you either need to have a photographic memory with total recall, or you need to take notes during discussions. Most piece of work start with an initial discussion of all the requirements, and you'll just be getting used to what the app is, what it does, where it gets data from etc. You are unlikely to be following the specific requirements of the new piece of work, and there is likely to be nuanced technical detail of how to approach the work and any special requirements for design patterns to follow. You'll build something that you think is useful, you'll demo it, then get another set of "new" requirements. Except they're not new, they're everything described in the first call, you just didn't make notes. This really is one of the biggest things I wish all engineers did. If you need all details written down for you, early stage start ups are not for you.

### Be an expert in your tech stack

Learn about the best practice for your focus area. If you're doing the react front end, keep completely on top of the latest react release notes to make sure you know what new functionality is landing soon that will speed up development. If you're building the API, make sure you know the appropriate design patterns and how to apply them to make a service that is super easy to work with. The focus is on easily maintainable code.

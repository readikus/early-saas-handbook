# How to succeed as an engineer at a SaaS startup

## Personal Traits

One of the most important factors for success of a seed stage startup is prioritisation. You are in a race against time to find product/market fit, so what we are working on needs to make the most use of our valuable time. This influences a lot of our technical decisions and how we approach work. Balancing this, with product quality, features and UX is something we should remind ourselves of every day.

As a developer, the important factors of success at an early stage start up are:

- Strikes a balance between innovation, technical excellence and delivery.
- Willing to ask when you are not sure how something works in the app.
- A willingness to do the boring stuff.
- Able to capture requirements comprehensively and ensure user stories fulfill all of them.
- A [learn-it-all](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/industry-blog/en-gb/cross-industry/2019/10/01/introduce-learn-it-all-culture/) outlook and be open to other people's ideas.

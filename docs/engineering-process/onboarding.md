# Get people coding on day one

When someone new starts, you want them to be able to get the local environment up and running quickly. If they are not able to get working on something on their first day, that is a bad sign!

## Factors that influence this:

- An onboarding checklist - the accounts and access needed to get up and running quickly.
- Reduce the faff necessary to get the app running on a new computer, quickly.
- Internal CLI tools - build scripts that improve how quickly you can run/reload all the local enviroment.
- Revise the documentation! If you spot an issue, fix it, so the next person onboarding doesn't have the same issue.
- Recommended tools list (i.e. vscode, slack blah blah blah)

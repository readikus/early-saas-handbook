# Surely product handle this, not engineering!

"I disagree - product should handle this!" typed the permenant disagreer on LinkedIn. I've always thought that, but I've worked with some dreadful product people, that significantly hold up the work. You can either moan about a situation, or you can be an adult and get the work done.

In my current role and a few previous ones, I've found myself forced to step up and build a product vision. I previously didn't follow much in the way of frameworks or guidance, because I was overwhelemed by all vast amounts of content and didn't know where to begin.

# Speak to users

Ideally the founders of the start up come from the industry they are targetting their product at. If not, be concerned! They need to have understood the pain this SaaS is solving.

Asana, Jira or Trello.

# Surely product handle this, not engineering!

One of the most common startup mistakes is prioritizing software development over effective product management. Should your investment go into building code that can be clicked, or should it be directed towards defining a product strategy that will connect with an audience?

Why are we talking about this in a guide to setting up an engineering team when product is a responsibility handled out of engineering? Experience suggests that the reality is quite different. A lot of non-engineers like to consider themselves as having a talent for product, but hey, I like to think I'm great at stuff I've never even read a book on.









"I disagree - product should handle this!" commented the perennial dissenter on LinkedIn. While I share this sentiment, my experience working with subpar product managers has led me to believe that the decision is not as straightforward. Complaining about a situation is one option, but the adult approach is to get the work done.



The number one start up mistake is putting time and money into building software rather than product management. 


Invest in some code and something that can be clicked, or invest in a quality product management?



"I disagree - product should handle this!" typed the permenant disagreer on LinkedIn. I've always thought that, but I've worked with some dreadful product people, that significantly hold up the work. You can either moan about a situation, or you can be an adult and get the work done.

These tend to be people from a non-engineering background, that have ended up in the role and not really done anything to familiarise themselves with the industry best practice. Unless you have someone in the company that has worked as an actual product manager in a software company, ideally one that has gone through the magical phase between seed and product/market








Founders typically under invest in product, and just want to cut some code.

I've found myself forced to step up and build a product vision. I previously didn't follow much in the way of frameworks or guidance, because I was overwhelemed by all vast amounts of content and didn't know where to begin.

## Does the idea actually work?

Do people actually want this? If not, look for another job ASAP.

# Build something people want: product 101

This section is covered first in the list, because without getting product right, you might as well not bother.

Product is easy to blag, really hard to do.

Finding a good product manager is like finding a good builder. Without one, however good you are as a dev, if you don't understand product, you've got problems.

# The Product Vision

This is unlikely to be crystal clear from the start - and certainly unlikely to be fully formed in the app. There is likely be a couple of screens, some basic features and a general idea.

# Recruit test users

Ideally the founders of the start up come from the industry they are targetting their product at, so already have candidates lined up. If not, be concerned! They need to have a clear understanding of the pain points this SaaS is solving.

Get a small number as early as possible who are onboard with the mission and slightly sympathetic that the product will not be perfect in the early incarnation. What they say (or don't say) will be some of the most valuable insight you can get.

# Pick a tool

Asana, Jira or Trello.

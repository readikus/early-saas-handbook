# Surely product handle this, not engineering!

One of the most common startup mistakes is prioritizing software development over effective product management. Should your investment go into building code that can be clicked, or should it be directed towards defining a product strategy that will connect with an audience?

Why are we talking about this in a guide to setting up an engineering team when product is a responsibility handled out of engineering? Experience suggests that the reality is quite different. A lot of non-engineers like to consider themselves as having a talent for product, but hey, I like to think I'm great at stuff I've never even read a book on.



# Product 101

There has been an infinite amount of text written about product that it seems silly to add to it. However, my observation is that so many people are absolutely terrible at it, so I'm collecting together the most important points that I feel can't be repeated enough.

For more indepth introductions to the subject, I highly recommend Marty Cagan's book _Inspired_ as a great place to start.

# MVP - Minimal Viable Product

Getting this understand wrong is the easiest way to really kill your SaaS. Take a minute to absorb that, and really think about it. From my experience, so few people involved in building tech products truely understand this.

Think about it like cars, but at a time when cars didn't exist. You could get places on your horse, train, or maybe on a bicycle (someone will contradict me and say that cars actually came first, but you get the point). At this point, your main goal is to be able to travel. You don't need doors, aircon, electric seats and all the luxuries. When you need to get somewhere, and there is no alternative, people are forgiving. Thankfully the pioneers of photography didn't hold off releasing their product until they achieved HDR colour.

I consider a solid MVP to consist of the following:

* A unique idea, solving an actual problem? If someone else is doing it but with dodgy UX, this is not enough.
* Can you build an MVP in under 6 months?
* Do you know your ideal user? Can you find someone in this position who is willing to test your product and give you feedback?
* Is there a revenue model and will anyone pay for it? Ad revenue doesn't really cut it anymore.

Should you do this idea?

* Is anyone else doing the same thing?


 If you're build


This is probably the easier






"I disagree - product should handle this!" commented the perennial dissenter on LinkedIn. While I share this sentiment, my experience working with subpar product managers has led me to believe that the decision is not as straightforward. Complaining about a situation is one option, but the adult approach is to get the work done.



The number one start up mistake is putting time and money into building software rather than product management. 


Invest in some code and something that can be clicked, or invest in a quality product management?



"I disagree - product should handle this!" typed the permenant disagreer on LinkedIn. I've always thought that, but I've worked with some dreadful product people, that significantly hold up the work. You can either moan about a situation, or you can be an adult and get the work done.

These tend to be people from a non-engineering background, that have ended up in the role and not really done anything to familiarise themselves with the industry best practice. Unless you have someone in the company that has worked as an actual product manager in a software company, ideally one that has gone through the magical phase between seed and product/market








Founders typically under invest in product, and just want to cut some code.

I've found myself forced to step up and build a product vision. I previously didn't follow much in the way of frameworks or guidance, because I was overwhelemed by all vast amounts of content and didn't know where to begin.

## Does the idea actually work?

Do people actually want this? If not, look for another job ASAP.

# Build something people want: product 101

This section is covered first in the list, because without getting product right, you might as well not bother.

Product is easy to blag, really hard to do.

Finding a good product manager is like finding a good builder. Without one, however good you are as a dev, if you don't understand product, you've got problems.

# The Product Vision

This is unlikely to be crystal clear from the start - and certainly unlikely to be fully formed in the app. There is likely be a couple of screens, some basic features and a general idea.

# Recruit test users

Ideally the founders of the start up come from the industry they are targetting their product at, so already have candidates lined up. If not, be concerned! They need to have a clear understanding of the pain points this SaaS is solving.

Get a small number as early as possible who are onboard with the mission and slightly sympathetic that the product will not be perfect in the early incarnation. What they say (or don't say) will be some of the most valuable insight you can get.

# Pick a tool

Asana, Jira or Trello.

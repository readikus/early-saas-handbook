I've seen quite a few posts this week about the practical use of AI in software engineering—so I thought I'd share the areas where I rely on it regularly:

🗣️ Team management – getting advice and rewriting communications for clarity and tone
 🧪 Pull request reviews – using Copilot to help analyze and speed up feedback
 🧠 Conceptual ideation – exploring different approaches to solve complex problems
 📝 Refining user stories – making them sharper, clearer, and more actionable
 💻 And of course... coding!

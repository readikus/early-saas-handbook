## ❌ Anti-Patterns That Kill Velocity (and Credibility)

### ❌ "I made all the changes manually because AI got it wrong once"

Congrats — you’ve now broken the AI’s context and set yourself up to do all the work alone. You're not collaborating, you're just firefighting.

### ❌ "This doesn’t work how I wanted, so AI sucks"

That’s junior-level thinking. If the output doesn’t land, clarify your goal, simplify your input, or explore alternatives. This is the same muscle we use working with humans — only faster.

### ❌ “I don’t trust it, so I’ll just do it all manually”

Cool. Enjoy your slow feedback loops and constant rework. Meanwhile, someone else is shipping faster *and* building better habits by pairing with AI correctly.

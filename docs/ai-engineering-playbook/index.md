I hate the term "playbook", but I also understand SEO and my audience, so apologises.


copilot-instructions.md

1. AI and vibe coding doesn't replace a good engineer, it speeds them up.
2. Get into the mindset.
3. Use Lovable/V0 for prototyping design
4. Setup Cursor project rules
5. Setup GitHub's Copilot for first stage of your PR review process.

The easier the engineering, the more stuff you can get done.

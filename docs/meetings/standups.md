# Standups that are Worth Getting Out of Bed For

Stand-ups are primarily used to ensure that a team is focused on the right work and to provide a regular cadence for dealing with any blocks or seeking clarity on issues. They help answer questions like, "What did you mean in this user story?" or "Have you considered that users might want to do X?"

## Main Format of a Stand-Up

The structure of a productive stand-up should be simple and focused:

1. **What you did yesterday.**
2. **What you're doing today.**
3. **Any blockers or need for clarity.**

Competent engineers should be able to provide their updates succinctly and clearly, ensuring the stand-up remains brief and to the point.

## Additional Tips for Effective Stand-Ups

- **Timebox the meeting:** Aim to keep the stand-up to 15 minutes or less. This encourages brevity and ensures the team can get back to work promptly.
- **Stand up during the meeting:** The physical act of standing can help keep the meeting short and focused.
- **Use a common board:** Visual aids like Kanban boards or task boards can help everyone stay on the same page and see the progress at a glance.
- **Encourage team participation:** Everyone should have a chance to speak. If someone is consistently quiet, encourage them to share their updates.
- **Address blockers immediately:** If a blocker is mentioned, the team should quickly discuss possible solutions. If the issue requires a longer discussion, schedule a follow-up meeting with the relevant parties.
- **Rotate facilitators:** Having different team members facilitate the stand-up can keep things fresh and ensure everyone stays engaged.

## Red Flags

While stand-ups are designed to be efficient and informative, there are a few red flags to watch out for:

- **"Been working on stuff":** Don't be vague. Specificity is key to providing useful updates.
- **Repeatedly dominating the meeting:** If you find yourself talking more than others, it may be a sign you're not being concise. This behavior is really disrupt, indicate poor communication skills and lack of respect for the rest.
- **Discussing non-relevant topics:** Stand-ups should focus on the current sprint and immediate issues. Long-term planning and off-topic discussions should be taken offline.
- **Using technical jargon:** Avoid using jargon that might not be understood by all team members. Clear communication is essential.

By following these guidelines and avoiding common pitfalls, we can make our stand-ups more effective and ensure they provide real value to the team.

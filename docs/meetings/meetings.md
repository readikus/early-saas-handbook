# Running inclusive meetings

Running effective and inclusive meetings is a really valuable skill, as it makes the best use of time for everyone involved, and helps build a sense of belonging.

* Whilst capturing requirements for a user story you are working on, take notes. Ideally in the user story, so they are shared between the rest of the team in a logical place. This is really important for ensuring that the correct requirement are delivered first time. Multiple meetings to cover the same requirements waste a lot of time.  
* Allow a dedicated moment for everyone to get so say what they needed to add. Everyone should be asked individually for their views, or, at least, encourage a "hands up" feature on zoom.
* Please don't interrupt.
* When a mix of remote/on site, it helps if everyone approachs the meeting as if they are remote.
* Webcam on.
* Try to stick within the allocated time boundaries, respecting people's time commitments outside the meeting.

A strong foundation in SQL is a game-changer for any tech career. Understanding relationships, normalization, joins, indexes, and schema management gives you the ability to work efficiently with data—an essential skill in nearly every engineering role.

Many junior engineers start with a front-end focus before expanding into full-stack development. Almost every application relies on data storage, and chances are, you’ll encounter an SQL-based relational database along the way.

Want to move up from front end to full stack, or from junior to senior? Start by mastering SQL—it’s a skill that will serve you for years to come.

I first learned SQL in 1997, and remarkably, the main concepts are still the same today. It’s one of the few engineering skills that truly stands the test of time.

Take indexes, for example—their impact on performance is so significant that they can make or break a system.

I once worked on a large logistics platform that needed to process a full day’s transactions within 24 hours. As demand grew, processing times stretched dangerously close to exceeding that window, which would have rendered the platform unviable. The solution? Adding a few simple database indexes, which slashed processing time from nearly a full day to just a few hours.

Relational databases may not be the most exciting part of tech, but they are absolutely foundational. Ignore them at your own risk!

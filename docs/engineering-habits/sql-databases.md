title: Engineering Super Power - Master SQL Database Design & Optimisation

A strong foundation in SQL is a game-changer for any tech career. Understanding relationships, normalization, joins, indexes, and schema management gives you the ability to work efficiently with dataâ€”an essential skill in nearly every engineering role.

Many junior engineers start with a front-end focus before expanding into full-stack development. Almost every application relies on data storage, and chances are, youâ€™ll encounter an SQL-based relational database along the way.

Want to move up from front end to full stack, or from junior to senior? Start by mastering SQLâ€”itâ€™s a skill that will serve you for years to come.

I first learned SQL in 1997, and remarkably, the main concepts are still the same today. Itâ€™s one of the few engineering skills that truly stands the test of time.

Take indexes, for exampleâ€”their impact on performance is so significant that they can make or break a system.

I once worked on a large logistics platform that needed to process a full dayâ€™s transactions within 24 hours. As demand grew, processing times stretched dangerously close to exceeding that window, which would have rendered the platform unviable. The solution? Adding a few simple database indexes, which slashed processing time from nearly a full day to just a few hours.

Relational databases may not be the most exciting part of tech, but they are absolutely foundational. Ignore them at your own risk!

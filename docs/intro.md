# Introduction

You've been working in software engineering for a while, maybe managed people for a few years, but suddenly you're in at an early stage start up, and you're thinking what to do! This is the handbook I wished I had when I started my role 6 months ago.

# The Golden Rules

- There is never enough time. One of the most important factors for success of an early stage startup is prioritisation. You are in a race against time to find product/market fit, so what we are working on needs to make the most use of our valuable time. This influences a lot of technical decisions and you approach work. Balancing this, with product quality, features and UX is something we should remind ourselves of every day.

- Be professional - communication needs to be professional and considerate at ALL TIMES. I have learnt this the hard way, but this is one of the most important basics. Losing your temper only makes _you_ look bad, and creates bad tension in the team. If you have an under performer, deal with them in a clear, structured, professional way. Besides, if they got through the tech interview round and are under performing, explore what is happening. It's a lot easier to not say something than it is to unsay it.

- Make actions or notes. Don't have a conversation about work without any outcomes.

- Time box meetings and keep focused Don't randomly cover lots of subjects in meetings.

* Ask when you are not sure how something works in the app or howx§should work in the .

Launch now
Build something people want
Do things that don't scale
Startups can only solve one problem well at any given time
Be nice! Or at least don’t be a jerk
Get sleep and exercise - take care of yourself

- Speak up when you are not sure.

- Don't settle for an ok product manager.

- Everyone needs to understand and emphasise with the users.

As a developer, the important factors of success at an early stage start up are:

- Strikes a balance between innovation, technical excellence and delivery.

- A willingness to do the boring stuff.
- Able to capture requirements comprehensively and ensure user stories fulfill all of them.
- A [learn-it-all](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/industry-blog/en-gb/cross-industry/2019/10/01/introduce-learn-it-all-culture/) outlook and be open to other people's ideas.
- Engaged in what we are delivering and care about delivering quality work for our audience.
- Not needing to be reminded of the same issues every PR.
- Reduces technical debt when possible as part of developing new features.
- Closely follows our [coding standards](./coding-standards).
- Throughly read and pre-review your code before requesting a review. Remove any commented out code, unnecessary new lines, and check comments are added for edge cases.
- Discusses large technical changes with the team before implmenting them.
- Test-driven mindset.
- Contributes to the culture and education of the tech team.

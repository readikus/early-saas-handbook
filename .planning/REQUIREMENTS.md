# Requirements: Startup Engineer Handbook — Landing Page & Navigation Redesign

**Defined:** 2026-02-11
**Core Value:** Visitors immediately understand why this handbook exists and can navigate the content through a clear journey

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for the redesign. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Theme & Visual Identity

- [ ] **THEME-01**: Site uses a custom dark color palette replacing default Infima green, inspired by Linear's aesthetic
- [ ] **THEME-02**: Dark mode is the default theme when a user first visits
- [ ] **THEME-03**: Site uses a clean modern font stack (system fonts or loaded web font) replacing Docusaurus default
- [ ] **THEME-04**: Color palette and typography are consistent across all page types (landing, docs, category, 404)

### Landing Page

- [ ] **LAND-01**: Landing page has a hero section with "Stop building the wrong thing" value proposition and CTA
- [ ] **LAND-02**: Landing page has content preview sections showing what each part of the handbook journey covers
- [ ] **LAND-03**: Default Docusaurus placeholder SVGs and generic feature cards are removed and replaced

### Navigation

- [ ] **NAV-01**: Top-level navbar items are grouped into 2-3 dropdown categories (down from 6 flat items)
- [ ] **NAV-02**: Navigation labels tell a journey story (understand the problem → build the team → build the product)
- [ ] **NAV-03**: Active section is visually indicated in the navbar

### Footer & Cleanup

- [ ] **FOOT-01**: Footer contains links to major content sections with proper attribution
- [ ] **FOOT-02**: All Docusaurus placeholder links are removed (Stack Overflow, Discord, Twitter community links)
- [ ] **FOOT-03**: Blog content is accessible through the main handbook navigation (not a separate section)

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Enhanced Content Experience

- **EXP-01**: "What to read next" prompts at end of doc pages
- **EXP-02**: Author/credibility section on landing page
- **EXP-03**: Social proof or testimonials

### Advanced Navigation

- **NAV-04**: Audience-specific landing sections (eng lead vs founder paths)
- **NAV-05**: Reading progress indicator
- **NAV-06**: Custom doc page layout with enhanced sidebar

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Content restructuring | Docs stay where they are — UI-only changes |
| New written content | This is a visual redesign, not a content project |
| Newsletter/email capture | Interrupts reading flow, not core to value |
| User accounts/auth | Static site, no backend needed |
| Elaborate animations | Distracts from content, increases bundle size |
| Search redesign | Docusaurus built-in search is sufficient |
| Mobile app / PWA | Web-first, static site |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Dark theme by default — Matches Linear aesthetic, feels modern and polished
- Journey-based nav over role-based — Content flows as a progression, not a reference manual
- UI-only changes, no content restructure — Keeps scope tight, avoids breaking existing links
- "Stop building the wrong thing" as hero hook — Leads with the problem, most compelling entry point
